# Chapter - 1: Hello Flutter

Let's create the first __Hello Flutter__ Application. By the end of this chapter, we shall be able to display the texts onto the screen.

## 1.0: Setup & Installation

First and foremost we need to install flutter SDK and the development environment. There are detailed instructions provided at flutter home page.  Please see the instructions at https://flutter.io/setup/ 

You may use any editor of your choice to write Dart code, however, if you want a proper IDE, I'll recommend IntelliJ IDEA CE with Flutter plugin.

Post setup and installation, the way to create the first app by calling the following

```
flutter create myapp
```

It will create a folder called `myapp`. There will be a file called `lib/main.dart` which is where all the code will be written. Please remove all the generated code to start afresh

## 1.1: The Code Structure

The code structure starts with a `main()` function which loads a widget. For simplicity, we can consider a single widget as a container (visible/invisible), which loads other widgets. 


## 1.2: Hello Flutter 

Everything is a widget in flutter, so Text has to be displayed using what we call `Text widget`. However, before we go ahead and display texts on screen, we need to remember a couple of points about the widgets.

Technically, though not differentiated explicitly in flutter, we can consider widgets are of two types. 
- Widgets which can act as a container and hold different widgets inside it
- Child only widget, which needs a container widget as a parent 
 
The `Text Widget` is a child only widget and needs a parent container widget to display itesel. We'll use the widget `Directionality` which determines the text direction as a container widget for the same.

So basically here is how our screen will look like

![Hello Flutter Widget](https://github.com/DakshHub/Flutter_MobileApp_Development/blob/master/Chapter-%201/Widget%20First.png)


The first line of code is about importing the basic material so that we can call the `runApp()` function which draws the widget.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

The function `runApp()` takes a widget, which is created using `new` keyword. Let's name the widget as `MyApp`

```
void main() {
  runApp(new MyApp());
}

```
We will create MyApp as a stateless widget which draws a container called `Directionality' which contains a child widget called 'Text`

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Directionality
      (
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
        child: new Text("Hello Flutter")
    );
  }
} 

```

## 1.3: Hello Flutter Code

To draw a widget, `build(...)` function is called and that's why we overwrite the base class function. Whatever widgets we'll create inside this function will be drawn on screen
